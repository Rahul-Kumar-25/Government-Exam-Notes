  <h2>Lithic Age or Stone Age</h2>
  <p><strong>Time Period:</strong> 30,00,000 BC to 1000 BC</p>

  <p>
    Some archaeological evidences were found in which stone implements are in great amount,
    that’s why this period is called Lithic Age or Stone Age.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Lithic Age is divided into three periods:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Palaeolithic Age or Old Stone Age</li>
    <li>Mesolithic Age or Middle Stone Age</li>
    <li>Neolithic Age or New Stone Age</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Palaeolithic Age</h2>
  <p><strong>Time Period:</strong> 30,00,000 BC to 10,000 BC</p>

  <p>
    Discovery of palaeolithic archaeological material was made by
    <strong>Robert Bruce Foote</strong> in <strong>1851</strong>.
    He discovered a palaeolithic implement <strong>Hand Axe</strong> in the
    district of Tamil Nadu (Chingleput district of Tamil Nadu).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>R.B. Foote</strong> is known as the <strong>Father of Pre-historic Archaeology</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In <strong>1982</strong>, <strong>Arun Sonakia</strong> discovered a woman’s skull from
    <strong>Hathnora</strong>, a place situated in the <strong>Narmada River valley</strong>,
    Hoshangabad district of Madhya Pradesh.
  </p>

  <p>
    As per Arun Sonakia, this human skull belongs to the category of
    <strong>Homo erectus</strong>.

    <li>(ii) Middle Palaeolithic Age</li>
    <li>(iii) Upper or Later Palaeolithic Age</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>(i) Lower or Earlier Palaeolithic Age</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>People used quartzite and other stones to make tools, implements and weapons</li>
    <li>
      Cultures of Lower Palaeolithic period are divided into:
