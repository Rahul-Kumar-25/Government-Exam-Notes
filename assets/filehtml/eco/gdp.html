  <h2>GDP (Gross Domestic Product)</h2>

<p>
Total final value of goods &amp; services produced within domestic territory of a country
in specified time period.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Methods of Calculating GDP</h2>

<h3>1. Product or Value Added Method</h3>

<p>
Value added by a firm = value of final good − value of initial good
</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Farmer producing wheat of ₹100 without any assistance</p>

<p>
Farmer → ₹100<br>
Wheat produced = ₹50 (consumption) + ₹50 (selling)
</p>

<p>
Baker → ₹200<br>
Bread produced = ₹150 (value added) + ₹50 (bought)
</p>

<p><strong>Then total GDP:</strong></p>

<p>
Value added by Baker + Value added by Farmer<br>
= ₹(200 − 50) + 100<br>
= ₹250
</p>

<h3>Production Method</h3>

<p>
GDP → Final value of all goods produced
</p>

<p>
= Final value of wheat + Final value of bread<br>
= ₹50 (consumed) + ₹200 (bread)
</p>

<p>
Only this is final good, other wheat is investment good
</p>

<p><strong>Total GDP = ₹250</strong></p>

<hr>

<h3>2. Expenditure Method</h3>

<p>
Whatever goods and services are produced in the economy are ultimately purchased by
the four sectors of the economy:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Household sector</li>
  <li>Government sector</li>
  <li>Private sector</li>
  <li>External sector</li>
</ul>

<p>
If we add the expenditure done by these four sectors on final goods and services
produced within the domestic territory, it will be equal to GDP.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Household sector spends on consumption (C')</li>
  <li>Private sector spends only on capital goods (I')</li>
  <li>Government sector purchases both capital &amp; consumption goods (G')</li>
  <li>External sector purchases both consumption and capital goods → Export (X')</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>GDP = C' + I' + G' + X'</strong>
</p>

<p>
C + I + G − (Cm + Im + Gm) + X<br>
= C + I + G + X − M
</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p>
GDP = Private consumption + Private investment + Government investment + Government
consumption + Export − Import
</p>

<p>
GDP = Total consumption + Total investment + Export − Import
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Major Components of GDP</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Private consumption → 60%</li>
  <li>Government consumption → 11%</li>
  <li>Total investment → 29%</li>
  <li>Exports → −3%</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p>
When government and external sector are present, savings and investment may vary,
but generally rise in savings leads to rise in investment.
</p>

<p>
Household can spend income on:
</p>

<p>
Consumption + Saving + Tax
</p>

<p>
GDP = C + S + T
</p>

<p>
C + I + G + X − M = C + S + T
</p>

<p>
(I − S) + (G − T) = M − X
</p>

<p>
When G = T = M = X = 0, then I = S
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. Income Method</h3>

<p>
Sum of final goods produced in the economy is equal to the income received by
factors of production:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wages</li>
  <li>Rent</li>
  <li>Interest</li>
  <li>Profit</li>
</ul>

<p>
GDP = Profit earned by firms + Interest on capital + Rent for natural resources +
Wages earned by labour
</p>

<p>
GDP of India includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>All states’ gross domestic product</li>
  <li>Central activities (railways, defence, highways, etc.)</li>
  <li>Embassies located in other countries</li>
  <li>Fishing vessels, oil &amp; natural gas rigs operated in international waters</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Concept of Domestic Territory</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Political frontiers of a country including territorial waters</li>
  <li>Ships &amp; aircraft operated by residents between two or more countries</li>
  <li>Fishing vessels, oil &amp; gas rigs operated in international waters</li>
  <li>Embassies, consulates and military establishments abroad</li>
</ul>

<p>
GDP calculation by NSO (National Statistical Office) is done by:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Value added method</li>
  <li>Expenditure method</li>
</ul>

<p>
GDP includes contribution of foreign nationals working in India.
</p>

<p>
If output earned by Indian residents only (India or abroad) is calculated,
it is called <strong>GNP (Gross National Product)</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Income earned by NRIs is not part of GDP.
