<h3>Union / India And Its Union Territories</h3>

<p>Part I &nbsp;&nbsp; Article 1 to 4</p>

<h4>Article 1</h4>

<p>India i.e. Bharat</p>

<p>(India is a union of states mentioned)</p>

<p>
Article 1 describes India i.e. Bharat as a “union of state” rather than
“Federation of states”. Acc. to Dr. Ambedkar, the phrase “union of states”
has been preferred to “Federation of states” for two reasons :-
</p>

<p>(1) The Indian federation is not the result of an agreement among the states like the American federation.</p>

<p>(2) States have no right to secede the federation.</p>

<p>
Article 1, the territory of India can be classified into three categories :-
</p>

<p>(1) Territories of States</p>
<p>(2) Union Territories</p>
<p>(3) Territories that may be acquired by the govt. of India at anyone</p>

<p>
The names of state and union territories and their territorial extent are mentioned
in the first schedule of constitution.
