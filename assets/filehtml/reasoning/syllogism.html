<h1>Syllogism Complete Notes (Level 0 to Bank PO / Clerk Level)</h1>

<h2>What is Syllogism? (Level 0)</h2>
<p>
Syllogism is a type of logical reasoning question. In this topic, you are given
two or three statements and based on those statements, you have to decide
whether a conclusion is correct or not.
</p>
<p>
Important rule: You are not allowed to use real-world knowledge. Only believe
what is written in the statements.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Statements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All apples are fruits.</li>
  <li>All fruits are sweet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: All apples are sweet. (True)</p>

<h2>Basic Building Blocks of Syllogism</h2>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8">
  <tr>
    <th>Word</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>All</td>
    <td>100%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Some</td>
    <td>At least one</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>Zero</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Some…not</td>
    <td>At least one is outside</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Four Basic Types of Statements</h2>

<h3>1. All A are B</h3>
<p>Meaning: Every A is inside B.</p>
<p>Example: All dogs are animals.</p>

<h3>2. Some A are B</h3>
<p>Meaning: At least one A overlaps with B.</p>
<p>Example: Some students are boys.</p>

<h3>3. No A is B</h3>
<p>Meaning: A and B never overlap.</p>
<p>Example: No cat is a dog.</p>

<h3>4. Some A are not B</h3>
<p>Meaning: At least one A is outside B.</p>
<p>Example: Some boys are not tall.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Most Important Rule</h2>
<p>
Never assume extra information. Only what is definitely stated or guaranteed
is allowed.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Statement: Some boys are smart.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some boys are not smart – Not correct</li>
  <li>All boys are smart – Not correct</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>How Questions Are Asked in Exams</h2>
<p>Statements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All A are B</li>
  <li>Some B are C</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Some A are C</li>
  <li>Some C are A</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Method 1: Venn Diagram Method</h2>
<p>
This is the best method for beginners. Draw circles to represent the
statements and check whether the conclusion is definitely true.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Statements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All A are B</li>
  <li>All B are C</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: All A are C (True)</p>

<hr>

<h2>Method 2: Logical Thinking Method</h2>
<p>
After practice, you can solve questions without drawing diagrams by applying
logical rules.
</p>

<h3>Rule 1: All to Some Conversion (Valid)</h3>
<p>All A are B → Some A are B</p>

<h3>Rule 2: Some to All (Invalid)</h3>
<p>Some A are B → All A are B (Wrong)</p>

<h3>Rule 3: No Direct Negative Conclusion</h3>
<p>From "All A are B", you cannot conclude "Some A are not B".</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conversion Rules</h2>

<h3>Valid Conversions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All A are B → Some B are A</li>
  <li>No A is B → No B is A</li>
  <li>Some A are B → Some B are A</li>
</ul>

<h3>Invalid Conversions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some A are not B → Some B are not A (Wrong)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Bank PO / Clerk Level Concepts</h2>

<h3>1. Possibility Case</h3>
<p>
If a conclusion may or may not happen but is not guaranteed, it is called a
possibility case.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Statements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All A are B</li>
  <li>Some B are C</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: Some A are C (Possibility)</p>

<h3>2. Either – Or Case</h3>
<p>
If two conclusions contradict each other, only one can be true.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some A are B</li>
  <li>Some A are not B</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer: Either I or II</p>

<h3>3. Definitely True vs Possibly True</h3>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8">
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Definitely True</td>
    <td>100% follows</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Possibly True</td>
    <td>Can happen but not guaranteed</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<hr>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Using real-life knowledge</li>
  <li>Assuming extra information</li>
  <li>Confusing some with all</li>
  <li>Wrong conversion of some-not statements</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Final Exam Strategy</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Use Venn diagrams initially</li>
  <li>Check only definite conclusions</li>
  <li>Apply conversion rules carefully</li>
  <li>Check either-or cases</li>
  <li>Handle possibility cases carefully</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Golden Line</h2>
<p>
In syllogism, do not think like a human. Think like a machine.
